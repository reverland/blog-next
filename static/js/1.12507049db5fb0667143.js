I haven't write a single line of web \nfrontend code for nearly three years except some `xss` code, but I still know what `npm` it is.\n\nI know I should install `Nodejs` first, so I typed:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y nodejs\n```\n\nMinutes passed by, a fresh new Nodejs was installed. I was satified as if I met a old friend.\n\nI typed the command\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nHowever, it surpised me that no `npm` is installed when nodejs installed on my system.Ok, ok\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y npm\n```\n\nThree years has passed, I dont know whether my code still works. I remember in nodejs world, \ncode quality is always suspectable, poor api compatibility and radical development will always bite \nyou hard.\n\nNevertheless, three years has passed. I choose the nodejs and npm bundled with ubuntu(however in subsystem),\nIt may be the nodejs/npm version I write my blog system three years ago, who knows.\n\nEverything went smoothly, so I just typed:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nI've heard from colleagues work on web frontend development that npm has change alot since I leave.\ndevelopers add more feature and it has become a quick, flexible and robust package manager for nodejs.\nEven better than `yarn`. When the last time I work as a FE worker, the speed yarn handle things makes \nme appreciate, despite I prefer npm more.\n\nBut it was still slow, I checked the dependencies and thought some may work or not. It will really comfort to \nthe semantic version? ten minutes passed, the installation process failed.\n\nI didnt really understand the error log, it couldt find files? but I think it will just disapear if I retry, as my experience\nin programming told me. \n\nAnd it truly disapear...\n\nthen I added some of my never published posts and begin\n\n```bash\nnpm build\n```\n\nI hope it work, but half of the hour passed, I even finished this post, in which to announce I'm backing.\n\nIt still not finish building.\n\nI suspect it will never finish for some unknown breaking changes.\n\n## Later Posts\n\nMaybe some posts on cryptography.\n\nI walked through [Dan Boneh's Cryptography](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto) again after coursera delete and recreate this course.\n\nIt looks like a _new_ course for me, I've forgot nearly everything. If I didnt find a passing course email received in year 2013, hardly could I believe I've passed this course ever.\n\n\nAnother interesting things I messed with these months is [a crypto challenge](http://cryptopals.com/). It worth you making you hands dirty if you are interested in cryptography.\n\nI'm curious about all of this and that magics around the world. However, I have to denote nearly all my energy into *work*, and its really hard to make time to learn magic things and enjoy them after a day of working.\n\nI hate work definately, but it really feeds me so I don't have to worry about food and shed.\n\n> Hack for fun, Work for live.\n\nOh, god. the blog system wakeup from three years ago is still building my posts.\n\nThen I find I just suspend terminal for windows subsystem is a little wired, when you click a running terminal, it will suspend it...\n\nHollyshit! The blog system still works and runs as quickly as a lightning!\n\nHonor to amazing javascript community.\n",metaData:{layout:"post",title:"I'm back again",excerpt:"After nearly three years without posting here, I'm back again.",category:"Life",tags:["life"],disqus:!0}}}});
